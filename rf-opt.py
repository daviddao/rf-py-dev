'''
RF Opt function taking following arguments:
- start_tree  : first tree to be considered
- end_tree : last tree to be considered
- file : path to the bips.txt, extracted by RAxML
- save (optional) : saving dropsets into a file called drops.txt

returns:
- scoring.txt : a scoring for all dropsets
